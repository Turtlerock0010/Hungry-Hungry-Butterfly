## About
Welcome to ADD V code respository, A repository for the programmers of Mini FRC team [83] Pink Fluffy Unicorns. Code will be updated and changes will be documented in the [discussion page](https://github.com/Turtlerock0010/ADD-V/discussions/categories/changes) for changes. For team members accessing the code to push into the NoU3, please use `main.ino` as any code in the file should have the latest and most reliable code. A guide on the innerworkings of the code will be created below.
